### Task 1: arrayManipulation.js

- Created a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: formatArrayStrings

- Added a function `formatArrayStrings` that takes an array of strings and an array of numbers. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes if the number is even, and converts to lowercase if odd.
